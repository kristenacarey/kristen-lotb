Why work at the Lair?

The Lair leaves a permanent mark on the rest of your life. Trust me, you want to be a part of it. 


You create the richest, most cherished friendships. 
Your fellow staffers are not just your co-workers. They become the backbone for the world you live in for the summer. You will have unique experiences that bond you to each member of the staff and heavily rely on them. Each staffer brings something unique, and you have the opportunity to learn from them.
